This README file contains information on the contents of the
custom layer as introduced in the "Adding a new software layer" on the
"Embedded Linux Projects using Yocto Project Cookbook" published by Packt 
Publishing in 2015.

Please see the corresponding sections below for details.

Dependencies

I. Adding the custom layer to your build
=================================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the custom layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the custom layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-custom \
    "


II. Misc
========

This layer should be used in conjunction with the "Embedded Linux Projects
using Yocto Project Cookbook" published by Packt Publishing in 2015.

The commits are named with the chapter and recipe number they belong to:
